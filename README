-Installing converter:
su root
make install

If you want to integrate converter with kde services menu:
 Only for the logged user
 ./generate_kde_services 
 Or Systemwide:
 su root
 ./generate_kde_services 

-Running converter

Execute command "converter [input_file] [output_file]" to convert files
or open konqueror, right click on a file to convert->Actions and select one Magic Clone action

Run "converter --list-filters" to get the filters available.

You can convert a file in one pass, for example:
converter input.wav output.mp3
It runs the wav to mp3 filter

And you can also convert a file in two passes, for example:
You need to convert avi to mp3, so, there is one filter to convert:
 * avi to wav
And another to convert:
 * wav to mp3
So, the converter guesses the filters (avi to wav, then waw to mp3) and runs them
